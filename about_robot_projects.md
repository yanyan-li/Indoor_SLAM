### Robot (Software) For Steel Cutting @UTS-SZ
*To aid steel forging companies in optimizing the utilization of scrap steel resources and minimizing mineral mining during the forging process, our team has developed an intelligent scrap steel cutting system. This sophisticated system conducts a comprehensive three-dimensional reconstruction of the cutting workspace, facilitating the automatic identification of the type and size of the scrap steel object designated for cutting. Furthermore, the 8 Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) module, comprising a 2 DoF truss and a 6 DoF robot arm, generates planning results based on the outcomes of the recognition module. The final step involves deploying the robot arm, equipped with a high-temperature cutting gun, to execute the cutting tasks with optimal efficiency.*

**Key Words:** Scene Reconstruction, Classification, Planning, ROS 

**Time:** 2023.09-2024.01
