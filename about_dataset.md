  **First**, we've designed a dataset generator tailored for both real and simulated scenes. In real scenes, it maintains real measurements, observation relationships, and occlusion dynamics, while in simulated scenes, it augments the dataset's diversity by introducing a variety of specialized trajectories and measurements. **Second**, a SLAM baseline is proposed to evaluate widely used modules in pose estimation tracking, mapping, parametrization, and optimization modules using our dataset.
