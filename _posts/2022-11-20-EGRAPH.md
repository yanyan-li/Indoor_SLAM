 A new minimal solution is proposed to solve relative rotation estimation between two images without overlapping areas by exploiting a new graph structure, which we call Extensibility Graph (E-Graph). Differently from a co-visibility graph, high-level landmarks, including vanishing directions and plane normals, are stored in our E-Graph, which are geometrically extensible. Based on E-Graph, the rotation estimation problem becomes simpler and more elegant, as it can deal with pure rotational motion and requires fewer assumptions, e.g. Manhattan/Atlanta World, planar/vertical motion. Finally, we embed our rotation estimation strategy into a complete camera tracking and mapping system which obtains 6-DoF camera poses and a dense 3D mesh model.
